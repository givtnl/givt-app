    "termsTextGb": "GIVT LTD \n\nTerms of use – Givt app \nLast updated: 24-11-2023\nVersion: 1.5\n\n1.  \tGeneral \nThese terms of use describe the conditions under which the mobile application Givt (\"Givt\") can be utilised. Givt allows the User (anonymously) to give donations through their smartphone, for example churches, fundraising campaigns or charities that are members of Givt Ltd.  \n\nThese terms of use apply to the use of Givt. Through the use of Givt (which means the download and the installation thereof), you (\"the User\") accept these terms of use and our privacy policy (https://givt.co.uk/privacystatementgivt-service). These terms of use and our privacy policy are also available on our website to download and print. We may revise these terms of use from time to time. \n\n2.  \tLicense and intellectual property rights \n\n2.1\tAll rights to Givt, the accompanying documentation and all modifications and extensions thereto as well as the enforcement thereof are and remain the property of Givt. The User is granted solely the rights and authorities and/or permissions ensuing from the effect of this agreement or which are assigned in writing, and you may not otherwise use, reproduce or publicly release Givt. \n\n2.2\tGivt grants the User a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transmittable license to use Givt. The User is not allowed to use Givt for commercial purposes. \n\n2.3  \tThe User may not provide Givt to third parties nor sell, rent, decompile, submit to reverse engineer or modify it without prior permission from Givt. Nor should the User, or let others, remove or bypass the technical provisions that are intended to protect Givt. \n\n2.4 \tGivt has the right to change Givt at any time, modify or remove data, deny the User the use of Givt by termination of the license, limitation of the use of Givt or deny access to Givt in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently. Givt will inform the User about this in an appropriate manner. \n\n2.5 \tThe User acquires no right, title or interest to the intellectual property rights and/or similar rights to (the means of) Givt, including the underlying software and content.\n\n3. \tThe use of Givt \n\n3.1 \tThe User can only give donations to churches, charities, fundraising campaigns and/or other legal entities that are affiliated with Givt. The donations are done anonymously. \n\n3.2  \tThe use of Givt is at your own risk and expense and should be used in accordance with the purposes for which it is intended. It is prohibited to reverse engineer the source code of Givt or to decompile and/or modify Givt, to make a copy of Givt available to any third party or to remove, delete or render illegible any designations of Givt as the party holding rights to Givt or parts thereof.\n\n3.3\tThe User is responsible for the correct submission of data such as name and address details, bank account number and other information as requested by Givt to ensure the use of Givt. \n\n3.4\tIf the User is under the age of 18 they must have the consent of their parent or legal guardian in order to use Givt. By accepting these terms of use, the User guarantees that they are 18 years of age or have the permission of their parents or legal representative. \n\n3.5 \tGivt is available for the operating systems Android and iOS. In addition to the provisions set out below, Apple’s App Store or Google Play may attach conditions to the acquisition of Givt, its use and related matters. For further information, see the terms of use and privacy policy of Apple’s App Store and Google Play as well as any other applicable terms and conditions appearing on the website of the respective provider. This end user licence is applicable to the agreement between the User and Givt and does not apply between the User and the provider of the platform through which you acquired Givt. That provider may hold you liable for violation of provisions in this end user licence, however.\n\n3.6\tAfter the User has downloaded Givt, the User is requested to register. In doing so, the User must provide the following information: (i) name (ii) address, (iii) phone number, (iv) bank account number, and (v) e-mail address. The privacy policy of Givt is applied to the processing of personal data via Givt. The User must inform Givt immediately if any of this data changes by correcting the information within the app.\n\n3.7\tThe User may, after installing the Givt app, also choose to only enter an e-mail address and immediately use the app to donate. After the donation, the User will be asked to complete the registration procedure. If the User wishes to do so later, Givt ensures to only use the User's e-mail address to remind the User to finish the registration procedure until this procedure is finalised.\n\n3.8 \tThe User is responsible for any expenses related to the equipment, software system and (internet) connection to make use of Givt.\n\n3.9 \tGivt provides the related services based on the information the User submits. The User is obliged to provide correct and complete information, which is not false or misleading. The User may not provide data with respect to names or bank accounts for which the User is not authorised to use. Givt and the Processor have the right to validate and verify the information the User has provided. \n\n3.10 \tThe User may at any time terminate the use of Givt, by deleting their account via the menu in the app or via mail to support@givt.app. Deleting the app from the smartphone without following aforementioned steps will not result in deletion of the User’s data. Givt can terminate the relationship with the User if the User does not comply with these terms and conditions or if Givt has not been used for 18 consecutive months. On request Givt can send a listing of all donation data. \n\n3.11 \tGivt does not charge fees for the use of Givt. \n\n3.12\tGivt has the right to adjust the offered functionalities from time to time to improve, to change or to fix errors. Givt will always work to fix errors within the Givt software, but cannot guarantee that all errors, whether or not in a timely fashion, be restored. \n\n4. \tProcessing transactions and Protecting your money\n\n4.1 \tGivt does not provide banking or payment services. To facilitate the processing of donations from the User, Givt has entered into an agreement with Access Paysuite Ltd, an Electronic Money Institution, authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FRN 730815) (“Access PaySuite”)(the \"Processor\"). Givt will, after the collection of donations, ensure the payment of donations to the user-designated beneficiary. The transaction data will be processed and forwarded to the Givt Processor. The Processor will initiate payment transactions whereas Givt is responsible for the transaction of the relevant amounts to the bank account of the Church/Charity as being the user-designated beneficiary of the donation.\n\n4.2 \tThe User agrees that Givt may pass the User’s (transaction and bank) data to the Processor, along with all other necessary account and personal information of the User, in order to enable the Processor to initiate the payment transactions and processing. Givt reserves the right to change the Processor at any time. The User agrees that Givt may forward the relevant information and data about the User as defined in article 4.2 to the new Processor to be able to continue processing payment transactions. \n\n4.3 \tGivt and the Processor will process the data of the User in accordance with the law and regulations that apply to data protection. For further information on how personal data is collected, processed and used, Givt refers the User to its privacy policy. This can be found at: (https://givt.co.uk/privacystatementgivt-service/).\n\n4.4 \tThe donations of the User will pass through Access PaySuite. Givt will ensure that the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary, with whom Givt has an agreement. \n\n4.5 \tThe User can reverse a debit at any time, within the terms of the User's bank, and the direct debit scheme. \n\n4.6 \tGivt and/or the Processor can refuse a donation if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a user is acting in violation of these terms or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a donation is possibly suspicious or illegal. In this case Givt will inform the User as soon as possible, unless prohibited by law. \n\n4.7\tUsers of the Givt app will not be charged for their donations through our platform. Givt and the receiving party have made separate compensation arrangements pursuant to the agreement in effect between them.\n\n4.8 \tThe User agrees that Givt may pass transactional data of the User to the HMRC, along with all other necessary account and personal information of the User, in order to assist the User with their annual tax return.   \n\n4.9\tWe will hold your money in a Client Funds Account, provided by Access PaySuite. The account is segregated from our own assets. The money contained in the Client Funds Account cannot be used by Givt, invested or lent to third parties, or in any way form part of Givt’s assets.\n\n4.10\tCurrent Regulatory Provisions exclude money placed on a Client Funds Account from the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).\n\n4.11\tMoney placed or held in the Client Funds Account shall not constitute a deposit (within the meaning of Article 5 of Directive 2006/48/EC) and does not earn interest.\n4.12\tDeposits and, in particular, withdrawals from the Client Funds Account will only be made in the following circumstances:\n\nIn the case of deposits:\n\nTo receive money intended for onward payment to the designated charity/charities or church(es)\nTo replenish the account where fees or other costs associated with running the account have been deducted\nTo receive refunds in the event that prior instruction to make a payment by you is cancelled, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions\n\nIn the case of withdrawals:\n\nTo pay designated charities and churches, in accordance with your instructions\nTo pay fees or other costs associated with running the account\nTo return money to you, in the event that prior instruction to make a payment by you is canceled, in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.\n\n5. \tSecurity, theft and loss \n\n5.1 \tThe User shall take all reasonable precautions safekeeping their login credentials for Givt to avoid loss, theft, misappropriation or unauthorised use of Givt on their device.\n\n5.2 \tThe User is responsible for the security of their device. Givt considers any donation from the Givt account as a user-approved transaction, regardless of the rights of the User under article 4.5.\n\n5.3 \tThe User shall inform Givt immediately via info@givt.app or +44 20 3790 8068 once their device is lost or stolen. Upon receipt of a message Givt will block the account to prevent (further) misuse. \n\n6.\tUpdates\n\n6.1\tGivt releases updates from time to time, which can rectify errors or improve the functionality of Givt. Available updates for Givt will be announced by means of notification through Apple’s App Store and Google Play and it is the User’s sole responsibility to monitor these notifications and keep informed about new updates.\n\n6.2\tAn update can stipulate conditions, which differ from the provisions in this agreement. The User will always be notified in advance so that they have the opportunity to refuse the update. By installing such an update, the User agrees to these new conditions, which will then form part of this agreement. If User does not agree to the changed conditions, they will have to cease using Givt and delete Givt from their device.\n\n7. \tLiability \n\n7.1 \tGivt has been compiled with the utmost care. Although Givt strives to make Givt available 24 hours a day, it accepts no liability if, for any reason, Givt is not available at any given time or for a certain period of time. Givt reserves the right to temporarily or permanently discontinue Givt (unannounced). The User cannot derive any rights from this. \n\n7.2 \tGivt is not liable for damage or injury resulting from the use of Givt. The limitations of liability as mentioned in this article shall lapse if the liability for damage is the result of intent or gross negligence on the part of Givt.\n\n7.3 \tThe User indemnifies Givt against any claim from third parties (for example, beneficiaries of the donations or HMRC) as a result of the use of the Givt or not correctly meeting the agreements made concerning legal or contractual obligations with Givt. The User will pay all damages and costs to Givt as a result of such claims.\n\n8. \tOther provisions \n\n8.1 \tThis agreement comes into effect on commencement of the use of Givt and will remain in force for an undetermined period from that moment. This agreement may be terminated by the User as well as by Givt at any moment, subject to one month’s notice. This agreement will end by operation of law in the event you are declared bankrupt, you apply for a moratorium on payments or a general attachment is levied against your assets, in the event of your death, or in the event you go into liquidation, are wound up or dissolved. Following the termination of this agreement (for whatever reason), you shall cease and desist from all further use of Givt. You must then delete all copies (including back-up copies) of Givt from all your devices.\n\n8.2\tIf any provision of these terms and conditions is void or destroyed, this will not affect the validity of the agreement as a whole, and other provisions of these terms remain in force. In that case, the parties will decide on a new replacement provision or provisions which will be in line with the intention of the original agreement as far as is legally possible.\n\n8.3 \tThe User is not allowed to transfer the rights and/or obligations arising from the use of Givt and these terms to third parties without prior written permission of Givt. Conversely, Givt is allowed to do so. \n\n8.4 \tWe will endeavor to resolve the dispute amicably. Any disputes arising from or in connection with these terms and conditions are finally settled in the Courts of England and Wales. \n\n8.5  \tThe Law of England and Wales is applicable on these terms of use. \n\n8.6 \tThe terms of use shall not affect the User's statutory rights as a consumer.\n\n8.7 \tGivt features an internal complaints procedure. Givt handles complaints efficiently and as soon as reasonably possible. Any complaint about the implementation of these conditions by Givt must be submitted in writing at Givt (via support@givt.app).\n\n\n",

    "termsText": "Terms of use – Givt app \nLast updated: 24-11-2023\nEnglish translation of version 1.10\n\n1. General \nThese terms of use describe the conditions under which the mobile application Givt (\"Givt\") can be utilised. Givt allows the User (anonymously) to give donations through their smartphone, for example churches, fundraising campaigns and charities that are members of Givt. Givt is managed by Givt B.V., a private company, located in Lelystad (8243 PR), Noordersluisweg 27, registered in the trade register of the Chamber of Commerce under number 64534421 (\"Givt B.V.\"). These terms of use apply to the use of Givt. Through the use of Givt (which means the download and the installation thereof), you (\"The user\") accept these terms of use and our privacy policy (www.givtapp.net/privacyverklaringgivt). These terms of use and our privacy policy are also available on our website to download and print. We may revise these terms of use from time to time. \n\n\n2.License and intellectual property rights\n2.1 All rights to Givt, the accompanying documentation and all modifications and extensions thereto as well as the enforcement thereof are and remain the property of Givt B.V. The user is granted solely the rights and authorities and/or permissions ensuing from the effect of this agreement or which are assigned in writing, and you may not otherwise use, reproduce or publicly release Givt. \n\n2.2 Givt B.V. grants the User a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transmittable license to use Givt. The User is not allowed to use Givt for commercial purposes. \n\n2.3 The User may not provide Givt to third parties nor sell, rent, decompile, submit to reverse engineer or modify it without prior permission from Givt B.V. Nor should the User, or let others, remove or bypass the technical provisions that are intended to protect Givt. \n\n2.4 Givt B.V. has the right to change Givt at any time, modify or remove data, deny the User the use of Givt by termination of the license, limitation of the use of Givt or deny access to Givt in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently. Givt B.V. will inform the User about this in an appropriate manner. \n\n2.5 The User acquires no right, title or interest to the intellectual property rights and/or similar rights to (the means of) Givt, including the underlying software and content.\n\n\n3. The use of Givt \n3.1 The User can only give donations to churches, charities, fundraising campaigns and/or other legal entities that are affiliated with Givt. The donations are done anonymously.\n \n3.2 The use of Givt is at your own risk and expense and should be used in accordance with the purposes for which it is intended. It is prohibited to reverse engineer the source code of Givt or to decompile and/or modify Givt, to make a copy of Givt available to any third party or to remove, delete or render illegible any designations of Givt B.V. as the party holding rights to Givt or parts thereof.\n\n3.3 The User is responsible for the correct submission of data such as name and address details, bank account number and other information as requested by Givt B.V. to ensure the use of Givt. \n\n3.4 If the User is under the age of 18 he/she must have have the consent of their parent or legal guardian in order to use Givt. By accepting these terms of use, the User guarantees that they are 18 years of age or has the permission of their parents or legal representative. \n\n3.5 Givt is available for the operating systems Android and iOS. In addition to the provisions set out below, Apple’s App Store or Google Play may attach conditions to the acquisition of Givt, its use and related matters. For further information, see the terms of use and privacy policy of Apple’s App Store and Google Play as well as any other applicable terms and conditions appearing on the website of the respective provider. This end user licence is applicable to the agreement between the User and Givt B.V. and does not apply between the User and the provider of the platform through which you acquired Givt. That provider may hold you liable for violation of provisions in this end user licence, however. \n\n3.6 After the User has downloaded Givt, the User is requested to register. In doing so, the User must provide the following information: (i) name (ii) address, (iii) phone number, (iv) bank account number and (v) e-mail address. The privacy policy of Givt B.V. is applied to the processing of personal data via Givt. The User must inform Givt immediately if any of this data changes by correcting the information within the app.\n\n3.7 The User may, after installing the Givt app, also choose to only enter an e-mail address and immediately use the app to donate. After the donation, the User will be asked to complete the registration procedure. If the User wishes to do so later, Givt B.V. ensures to only use the User's e-mail address to remind the User to finish the registration procedure until this procedure is finalised.\n\n3.8 The User is responsible for any expenses related to the equipment, software system and (internet) connection to make use of Givt.\n\n3.9 Givt B.V. provides the related services based on the information the User submits. The User is obliged to provide correct and complete information, which is not false or misleading. The User may not provide data with respect to names or bank accounts for which the User is not authorised to use. Givt B.V. and the Processor have the right to validate and verify the information the User has provided. \n\n3.10 The User may at any time terminate the use of Givt, by deleting their account via the menu in the app or via mail to support@givt.app. Deleting the app from the smartphone without following aforementioned steps will not result in deletion of the User’s data. Givt can terminate the relationship with the User if the User does not comply with these terms and conditions or if Givt has not been used for 18 consecutive months. On request Givt can send a listing of all donation data. \n\n3.11 Givt B.V. does not charge the User fees for the use of Givt. \n\n3.12 Givt B.V. has the right to adjust the offered functionalities from time to time to improve, to change or to fix errors. Givt B.V. will always work to fix errors within the Givt software, but cannot guarantee that all errors, whether or not in a timely fashion, be restored. \n\n\n4. Processing transactions \n4.1 Givt B.V. is not a bank/financial institution and does not provide banking or payment processor services. To facilitate the processing of donations from the User, Givt B.V. has entered into an agreement with a payment service provider called SlimPay. SlimPay is a financial institution (the \"Processor\") with which it was agreed that Givt B.V. sends the transaction information to the Processor in order to initiate and to handle donations. Givt B.V. will, after the collection of donations, ensure the payment of donations to the user-designated beneficiary. The transaction data will be processed and forwarded to the Givt Processor. The Processor will initiate payment transactions whereas Givt B.V. is responsible for the transaction of the relevant amounts to the bank account of the Church/Foundation as being the user-designated beneficiary of the donation.\n\n4.2 The User agrees that Givt B.V. may pass the User’s (transaction and bank) data to the Processor, along with all other necessary account and personal information of the User, in order to enable the Processor to initiate the payment transactions and processing. Givt B.V. reserves the right to change of Processor at any time. The User agrees that Givt B.V. may forward the relevant information and data about the User as defined in article 3.6 to the new Processor to be able to continue processing payment transactions. \n\n4.3 Givt B.V. and the Processor will process the data of the User in accordance with the law and regulations that applies to data protection. For further information on how personal data is collected, processed and used, Givt B.V. refers the User to its privacy policy. This policy can be found online (www.givtapp.net/en/privacystatementgivt-service/).\n\n4.4 The donations of the User will pass through Givt B.V. as an intermediary. Givt B.V. will ensure that the funds will be transferred to the beneficiary, with whom Givt B.V. has an agreement. \n\n4.5 The User must authorise Givt B.V. and/or the Processor (for automatic SEPA debit) to make a donation with Givt. The User can at all times, within the terms of the User's bank, revert a debit. \n\n4.6 Givt B.V. and/or the Processor can refuse a donation if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a user is acting in violation of these terms or if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a donation is possibly suspicious or illegal. In this case Givt B.V. will inform the User as soon as possible, unless prohibited by law. \n\n4.7 Users of the Givt app will not be charged for their donations through our platform. Givt and the receiving party have made separate compensation arrangements pursuant to the agreement in effect between them.\n\n4.8 The User agrees that Givt B.V. (transaction) may pass data of the User to the local tax authorities, along with all other necessary account and personal information of the User, in order to assist the User with his/her annual tax return.   \n\n\n5. Security, theft and loss \n5.1 The User shall take all reasonable precautions safekeeping their login credentials for Givt to avoid loss, theft, misappropriation or unauthorised use of Givt on their smartphone. \n\n5.2 The User is responsible for the security of his/her smartphone. Givt B.V.t considers any donation from the Givt account as a user-approved transaction, regardless of the rights of the User under article 4.5.\n\n5.3 The User shall inform Givt B.V. immediately via info@givt.app or +31 320 320 115 once their smartphone is lost or stolen. Upon receipt of a message Givt B.V. will block the account to prevent (further) misuse. \n\n6. Updates\n6.1 Givt B.V. releases updates from time to time, which can rectify errors or improve the functionality of Givt. Available updates for Givt will be announced by means of notification through Apple’s App Store and Google Play and it is the User’s sole responsibility to monitor these notifications and keep informed about new updates.\n\n6.2 An update can stipulate conditions, which differ from the provisions in this agreement. This will always be notified to the User in advance so that they have the opportunity to refuse the update. By installing such an update, the User agrees to these new conditions, which will then form part of this agreement. If User does not agree to the changed conditions, they have to cease using Givt and have to delete Givt from their device.\n\n7. Liability \n7.1 Givt has been compiled with the utmost care. Although Givt B.V. strives to make Givt available 24 hours a day, it accepts no liability if, for any reason, Givt is not available at any given time or for a certain period of time. Givt B.V. reserves the right to temporarily or permanently discontinue Givt (unannounced). The User cannot derive any rights from this. \n\n7.2 Givt B.V. is not liable for damage or injury resulting from the use of Givt. The limitations of liability as mentioned in this article shall lapse if the liability for damage is the result of intent or gross negligence on the part of Givt B.V.\n\n7.3 The User indemnifies Givt B.V. against any claim from third parties (for example, beneficiaries of the donations or the tax authority) as a result of the use of the Givt or not correctly meeting the agreements made concerning legal or contractual obligations with Givt B.V. The User will pay all damages and costs to Givt B.V. as a result of such claims.\n\n8. Other provisions \n8.1 This agreement comes into effect on commencement of the use of Givt and will remain in force for an undetermined period from that moment. This agreement may be terminated by the User as well as by Givt B.V. at any moment, subject to one month’s notice. This agreement will end by operation of law in the event you are declared bankrupt, you apply for a moratorium on payments or a general attachment is levied against your assets, in the event of your death, or in the event you go into liquidation, are wound up or dissolved. Following the termination of this agreement (for whatever reason), you shall cease and desist from all further use of Givt. You must then delete all copies (including back-up copies) of Givt from all your devices.\n\n8.2 If any provision of these terms and conditions is void or destroyed, this will not affect the validity of the agreement as a whole, and other provisions of these terms remain in force. In that case, the parties will decide on a new replacement provision or provisions which will be in line with the intention of the original agreement as far as is legally possible. \n\n8.3 The User is not allowed to transfer the rights and/or obligations arising from the use of Givt and these terms to third parties without prior written permission of Givt B.V. Conversely, Givt B.V. is allowed to do so. \n\n8.4 Any disputes arising from or in connection with these terms are finally settled in the Court of Lelystad. Before the dispute will be referred to court, we will endeavor to resolve the dispute amicably. \n\n8.5 The Dutch law is applicable on these terms of use. \n\n8.6 The terms of use shall not affect the User's statutory rights as a consumer.\n\n8.7 Givt B.V. features an internal complaints procedure. Givt B.V. handles complaints efficiently and as soon as reasonably possible. Any complaint about the implementation of these conditions by Givt B.V. must be submitted in writing at Givt B.V. (via support@givt.app).\n\n",

    "faQantwoord1": "Donating with your smartphone\n Givt is the solution for giving with your smartphone when you are not carrying cash. Everyone owns a smartphone and with the Givt app you can easily participate in the offering. \n It’s a personal and conscious moment, as we believe that making a donation is not just a financial transaction. Using Givt feels as natural as giving cash. \n \n\n Why 'Givt'?\n The name Givt was chosen because it is about ‘giving’ as well as giving a ‘gift’. We were looking for a modern and compact name that looks friendly and playful. In our logo you might notice that the green bar combined with the letter ‘v’ forms the shape of an offering bag, which gives an idea of the function. \n \n\n The Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom\n There is a team of specialists behind Givt, divided over the Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom. Each one of us is actively working on the development and improvement of Givt. Read more about us on www.givtapp.net.",

We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of those claims.\n 10. Disclaimers; No Warranties.\n THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. GIVT DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. GIVT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND GIVT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.\n NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR GIVT ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE GIVT ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE STATUS OF ANY ORGANIZATION, INCLUDING WHETHER AN ORGANIZATION IS A NOT-FOR-PROFIT, CHARITABLE, OR OTHER SIMILAR ORGANIZATION UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, AND WE DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE TAX TREATMENT OF ANY DONATIONS, GIFTS, OR OTHER MONEYS TRANSFERRED OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO ANY SUCH ORGANIZATION.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE GIVT ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY GIVT ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.\n 11.2. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 11.2 AND 11.3 AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE GIVT ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO US$100.\n 11.3. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\n 12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration\n 12.1. Generally. Except as described in Section 12.2 and 12.3, you and Givt agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.\n YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND GIVT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n 12.2. Exceptions. Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\n 12.3. Opt-Out. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 12 within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending an e-mail to Givt Inc. at support@givt.app, with the following subject line: “Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out”, that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once Givt receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 12 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 12.2. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.\n 12.4. Arbitrator. This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Givt.\n 12.5. Commencing Arbitration. Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by e-mail mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Givt’s e-address for Notice is: support@givt.app. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) include the following subject line: “Notice of Arbitration”; (b) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (c) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (d) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Givt may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Givt will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if Givt has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.\n 12.6. Arbitration Proceedings. Any arbitration hearing will take place in Fulton County, Georgia unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Givt must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. \n 12.7. Arbitration Relief. Except as provided in Section 12.8, the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brough in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Givt before an arbitrator was selected, Givt will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\n 12.8. No Class Actions. YOU AND GIVT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Givt agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  \n 12.9. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If Givt makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Givt’s address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with Givt will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.\n 12.10. Enforceability. If Section 12.8 or the entirety of this Section 12.10 is found to be unenforceable, or if Givt receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 12 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms. \n \n\n 13. Miscellaneous \n 13.1. General Terms. These Terms, including the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Givt regarding your use of the Service.

Givt will not collect, use, or disclose personal information from your child if you do not provide consent. As a parent, you provide your consent by completing a nominal payment card charge in your account on the Givt app. If you do not provide consent within a reasonable time, Givt will delete your information from its records, however Givt will retain any information it has collected from you as a standard Givt user, subject to Givt’s standard privacy policy www.givt.app/privacy-policy/\u2028\nThe Givt Privacy Policy for Children Under the Age of 13 www.givt.app/privacy-policy-givt4kids/ provides details regarding how and what personal information we collect, use, and disclose from children under 13 using Givt4kids (the “Application”).\u2028\nInformation We Collect from Children\nWe only collect as much information about a child as is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in an activity, and we do not condition his or her participation on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary. \u2028\nInformation We Collect Directly \nWe may request information from your child, but this information is optional.
